          <summary>How much does it cost to replace a windshield?</summary>
          <p> The cost of replacing a windshield can vary depending on several factors, including the make and model of your vehicle and the type of windshield required. Additionally, the extent of damage and additional services needed, such as recalibration for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), can impact the overall cost.

            Do the Autoglass Guys use OEM windshields?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Yes, at Autoglass Guys we try to use Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) windshields whenever possible. OEM windshields are manufactured to the same specifications as the original glass installed in your vehicle, ensuring a precise fit and maintaining the integrity of your vehicle's safety features.

            What should I avoid after getting a windshield replaced?
          </summary>
          <p>
            After getting your windshield replaced, it's important to follow a few precautions:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Avoid slamming doors or driving over speed bumps for the first 24 hours to allow the adhesive to cure properly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do not remove any retention tape or stickers placed by the technician, as they help in securing the windshield.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid using high-pressure car washes for the first 48 hours, as excessive water pressure can affect the adhesive bond.
              </li>
            </ul>

            What temperature do windshield cracks spread?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Extreme temperature changes can cause windshield cracks to spread. However, there isn't a specific temperature at which this occurs. It's best to address any cracks as soon as possible to prevent further damage, regardless of the temperature outside. 
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>
            Is it OK to have a cracked windshield?
          </summary>
          <p>
            It's not recommended to leave a cracked windshield unaddressed. Even small cracks can compromise the structural integrity of the glass and may worsen over time. Additionally, a cracked windshield can obstruct your vision and increase the risk of injury in the event of an accident. We recommend seeking professional assistance to evaluate and repair or replace your windshield promptly.
          </p>

            Is it safe to drive with a cracked windshield that is spreading?
          </summary>
          <p>
            Driving with a cracked windshield, especially one that is spreading, is not safe. The crack weakens the structural integrity of the glass, reducing its ability to protect you in the event of a collision. Additionally, a spreading crack may impair your visibility, making it dangerous to drive. We recommend getting your windshield repaired or replaced as soon as possible to ensure your safety on the road.

            Can I stop a crack in my windshield from spreading?
          </summary>
          <p>
            While there are various DIY methods suggested to stop a crack from spreading, they are temporary solutions at best. The most effective and long-lasting solution is to have the crack repaired or the windshield replaced by a professional. Our experienced technicians can assess the damage and recommend the best course of action to prevent the crack from spreading and ensure the safety of your vehicle.

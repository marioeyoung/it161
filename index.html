    <p>We'll use this page as a place for links to the work you've done, and stand as an example of how to build a <a href="https://www.liferay.com/resources/l/web-portal" target="_blank">portal</a> page to show our projects.</p>
    
    <p>Hi there, <br><br>Im a technically minded blue collar worker making a career change into the world of tech! I grew up playing with computers, and although I have not worked with them professionally in the past, I spend a great deal of my spare time tinkering and toying with fun new technologies. Currently I am running a D&D server on a raspberry pi, as well as a 3d printer with a web interface called Octoprint. I have run Minecraft servers as well as home entertainment services in the past, and I am always looking for a new project to keep learning.</p>
